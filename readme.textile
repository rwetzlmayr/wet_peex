h3. Peek into Textpattern using XML

*wet_peex* peeks for Textpattern objects as XML(Extensible Markup Language) resources.

h4. usage:

*wet_peex* is a backend plugin without any user interface. It handles HTTP GET requests and replies with an XML response.

To query @wet_peex@, send a request to the resource located at @http://yoursite.tld/textpattern?wet_peex@.

wet_peex understands these query parameters:

* @object_type@: @article@, @section@, @category@, @link@, @image@, @file@. Use one of these as a value for the @wet_peex@ GET parameter, e.g. @http://yoursite.tld/textpattern?wet_peex=article@
* @sort@: Sort criterion
* @dir@: Sort direction. Use either @asc@ for ascending sort order, or @desc@ for descending sort order
* @search@: Textual search criterion
* @offset@: First object's ordinal in reply
* @limit@: Maximum objects returned

A sample request:

@http://yoursite.tld/textpattern?wet_peex=article&sort=posted&dir=asc@

The XML reply message is rather self explanatory. View source for details. @article@ is the only currently implemented object type.
